##Roman numerals specifications

Introduction
Roman numerals are represented by seven different letters: I, V, X, L, C, D and M. Which represent the numbers 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000. These seven letters are used to make thousands of numbers. For example, the Roman numeral for two is written as 'II', just two one's added together. The numeral twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. If we take this a step further; the number twenty-seven is written as XXVII, which when broken down looks like XX + V + II.




Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, this is not always the case. The Romans didn’t like four of the same numerals written in a row, so they developed a system of subtraction.

The Roman numeral for three is written as ‘III’, however, the numeral for four is not ‘IIII’. Instead we use the subtractive principle. The number four is written as ‘IV’, the numerals for one and five. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as ‘IX’. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

  ⋅ I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
  ⋅ X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
  ⋅ C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
The number 1994 is a great example of these rules. It is represented by the Roman numerals MCMXCIV. If we break it down then; M = 1,000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
